    <p>Welcome to Game Of Life Multiplayer!</p>
    <p>Click on cells to make them alive and paint them with the color assigned to you (highlighted user icon is you).</p>

    <p>Game flows following these rules:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        <li>When a dead cell revives by rule #4, it will be given a color that is the average of its neighbors (that revive it).</li>
    </ol>
